# Subtasks

Subtasks isn’t just another run-of-the-mill to-do list, no sir! This little number comes with a nifty twist—subtasks! That’s right, you can add tasks within tasks, and even nest them further if you please. Why stop at one when you can have an endless web of organization?

At present, this project is a good ol’ Node.js API, but hold onto your hats! There are grand plans afoot for a first-rate frontend and a dazzling desktop application. Stay tuned, folks—this one’s bound to be a humdinger!
